This application is devoted to summer practice.
The main feature is to develop C# Windows Desktop application in order to process .doc files that contain information about academic groups' consultations. The information is stored in table. The main fields of the table are: the lecturer's name, the subject's title, groups' ids, consultations' date and time, place where the current consultation will be and some additional information. When all this information is processed, it is stored to a SQLite database and displayed on the main windows of the app. Later you can compare different databases and see the changes of the schedule.
